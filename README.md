6. When you press the Save Recipe button, a specific recipe is saved to your meal planning calendar.



### How to use Meal Planner

1. Recipes saved from the recipe search bar will be available in the meal planning calendar, allowing users to customize their meal planning calendar.

2. Users can select different meal types and add recipes to the meal planning calendar to be eaten on the desired date.

3. Recipes saved in the meal planning calendar will remain as separate json files even after the program is terminated, and when the user runs the program again, the previously saved meal planning calendar will be loaded.

## API Usage

In Recipe Wiz, we leverage the powerful **Edamam API** to enhance the user experience by providing comprehensive recipe search and nutritional analysis capabilities. Below is an overview of the APIs used and their functionality:

### 1. Recipe Search API

The **Recipe Search API** from Edamam is utilized to enable users to:

- Search for recipes based on ingredients, dietary restrictions, and meal types.
- Retrieve a rich dataset for each recipe, including:
    - Recipe title, image, and preparation steps.
    - Ingredients list with quantities.
    - Dietary labels (e.g., gluten-free, vegetarian).
    - Health labels (e.g., low-carb, keto-friendly).

This API ensures that Recipe Wiz provides tailored and diverse recipe suggestions for users with varying preferences and dietary needs.

### 2. Nutritional Analysis API

The **Nutritional Analysis API** from Edamam powers the nutritional information feature in Recipe Wiz. This API is used to:

- Analyze recipes to calculate detailed nutritional data, including:
    - Calories.
    - Macronutrients (protein, fat, carbohydrates).
    - Micronutrients (fiber, sugar, vitamins).
- Display easy-to-understand nutritional breakdowns for each recipe, helping users make informed dietary choices.
